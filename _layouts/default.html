        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This project investigates what makes a recipe highly rated on Food.com. By analyzing thousands of user-submitted recipes and their ratings, the goal is to predict a recipe's average rating based on metadata like preparation time, number of steps, and nutrition. I used exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning to build a model that predicts recipe ratings.

        <h2>Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
      
        <p>
            To explore and prepare the dataset for analysis, I first performed several cleaning and transformation steps to ensure the data was usable and meaningful for evaluating recipe ratings.
        </p>
       
        <h3>Merging Datasets</h3>
        <p>
            I began by merging the <code>Recipes</code> and <code>Ratings</code> datasets into a single DataFrame. Since each recipe can have multiple ratings, I performed a left merge using the <code>id</code> column from the <code>Recipes</code> table and the <code>recipe_id</code> column from the <code>Ratings</code> table.
        </p>
       
        <h3>Average Rating</h3>
        <p>
            Because each recipe has multiple user-submitted ratings, I calculated the average rating for each recipe using <code>groupby</code> on <code>recipe_id</code> and taking the mean of the <code>rating</code> values. I then mapped the resulting Series back to the full DataFrame using the <code>id</code> column. Before this, I replaced any rating values of 0 with <code>NaN</code> to avoid skewing the average.
        </p>
       
        <h3>Review Count</h3>
        <p>
            I was curious whether the number of reviews a recipe received correlated with its average rating. To explore this, I created a <code>review_count</code> column by using <code>value_counts()</code> on the <code>recipe_id</code> column and then mapping those counts back to the full dataset using the <code>id</code> column. I also filled any missing values with 0.
        </p>
       
        <h3>Health Score</h3>
        <p>
            To examine whether a recipe's healthiness impacted its rating, I created a <code>health_score</code> based on the nutritional data provided. I extracted individual nutritional values into separate columns (e.g., sugar, protein, sodium), assumed each recipe serves four people, and adjusted the values accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
            I then applied a weighting system to reflect the nutritional value of each component:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Positive weight</strong>: Protein (+2)</li>
            <li><strong>Negative weights</strong>: Sugar (-1.8), saturated fat (-1.5), total fat, carbs, calories (-1 each), and sodium (-0.5)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The resulting <code>health_score</code> was negative for healthier recipes and positive for less healthy ones, so I flipped the sign so that <strong>higher scores indicate unhealthier recipes</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Initially, some scores were unrealistically high (e.g., over 100,000), due to outliers such as a single recipe having a sugar PDV of 30,000. To fix this, I clipped extreme health score values between the 1st and 98th percentile. This reduced the total number of recipes from ~23,000 to ~22,000, the mean score from 62 to 49, and the standard deviation from 147 to 48. The maximum score also dropped from over 16,000 to 329.
        </p>
       
        <h3>Recipe Duration (Minutes)</h3>
        <p>
            Lastly, I addressed outliers in the <code>minutes</code> column, which included some recipes that took months to prepare. I clipped the top and bottom 1% of the <code>minutes</code> distribution to focus on recipes with realistic preparation times.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the data cleaned and key features engineered, I created several visualizations to explore how different factors influence recipe ratings. I found the strongest correlations with health score, number of ingredients, number of reviews, and number of steps        </p>
          <h3>Exploratory Visualizations</h3>

        <h2>Framing a Prediction Problem</h2>
        <p>
          The prediction target is <code>avg_rating</code>, a continuous value from 1 to 5. This is a <strong>regression</strong> problem. Features include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Preparation time (<code>minutes</code>)</li>
          <li>Number of steps (<code>n_steps</code>)</li>
          <li>Review count (<code>review_count</code>)</li>
          <li>Health score (<code>health_score</code>)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Baseline Model</h2>
        <p>
          I first used a <strong>Linear Regression</strong> model with the features above. It served as a baseline with:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mean Squared Error (MSE): <strong>0.58</strong></li>
          <li>R² score: <strong>0.12</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>This indicated a weak linear fit — more complex models were needed.</p>

        <h2>Final Model</h2>
        <p>
          I used a <strong>Random Forest Regressor</strong> with 100 trees, which better captured non-linear relationships.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mean Squared Error (MSE): <strong>0.45</strong></li>
          <li>R² score: <strong>0.35</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Key features included health score, review count, and number of steps.</p>
